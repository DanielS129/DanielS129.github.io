        <p> Hello My name is Daniel Sevilla. I am a student attending <a href="https://www.uri.edu">The University of Rhode Island.</a> <br>
            I am currently majoring in Computer Science to hopefully earn my Bachelors Degree in Computer <br>
            Science. 
        </p>
        <p> I enjoy playing soccer and volleyball. I played soccer most of my life where as I started playing <br>
            volleyball in my junior year of highschool. I attended a CTE high school where I attended the General<br>
            Construction program and have earned a recommendation for the Laborers Union and have earned my OSHA 30<br>
            card. I have also for most of my life helped my dad out with his bakery. I can say that I have some <br>
            experience in baking as well.
